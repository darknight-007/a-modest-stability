A Modest Stability <br> 
Three axis gimbals art installation

Lead artist: Jnaneshwar Das <br>
Co-artist: Christopher Filkins 

Project Summary: 
'A Modest Stability' is a 12' tall, three-axis interactive gimbals structure made out of aluminum, influenced by wind, and interactions with humans. It features internal and external lights that respond to the rings'
rotations and interactions with participants.

Physical Description: The installation features a 12' tall main boom supporting a 10' diameter outer ring, which pivots a 6' middle ring, and a 2' central ring. Made of lightweight aluminum tubes, it's designed for easy movement from wind or touch. The structure includes external lights for projection mapping and internal LED arrays within the rings, creating dynamic lighting effects triggered by the rings' rotations. Integrated inertial measurement units (IMUs) in each ring detect orientation, triggering effects when aligned. The lights, responsive to movement and velocity, glow when static and change with the structure's motion. The outer ring will be load bearing, allowing participants to hop on and lean inside the ring, or produce other interactions that involve tactile interactions.
